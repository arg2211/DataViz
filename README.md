Contains G4063 assignments and data visualization practice.

## *Assignment 1*

#### Big Graph
D3 visualization of roughly 5 hours of tweets collected about presidential candidates. Main goal is to demonstrate differences in frequency of tweets about each candidate in twenty-minute intervals.

#### Compare Bernie to Hillary
D3-created histogram of number of tweets about Bernie Sanders that transitions to number of tweets about Hillary Clinton.  Main goal is to compare frequency of tweets about both candidates in twenty-minute intervals.

#### Compare Cruz to Rubio
Histogram with same function as above but tweets about Cruz then transition to tweets about Rubio.

#### Shiny App
This R Shiny app uses 30 minutes of tweets that I collected about ten presidential candidates to create a tweet frequency plot and a word cloud; you can select one candidate to view at a time.  For the frequency plot, move the slider bar to change the number of bins in the plot. The word cloud shows a maximum of 250 words that were most commonly repeated in the tweets about the chosen candidate.
